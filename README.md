        <h4><strong>Rock paper scissors Heading</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                The heading I have chosen is a simple but elegant heading. The font I have chosen is Indie flower! It's a minimalistic design with focus on the different selection of hands used for playing the game.

        <h4>
        <strong>The Game Area</strong>
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    This is the section of the page where the user selects one of the hands in the game of Rock, paper, scissor, lizard & spock. To play against the computer.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The user has 5 differnet options to choose from, each option has a chance to to win or loose against 2 other options. If the computer picks the same hand as you have chosen there is a draw.

            <li>
                <p>
                This is the section of the game where a div located both on the left and on the right side of the screen. The square on the left side of the screen will show what the user has selected, and the square on the right side of the screen will show what the computer has generated.

        <h3><strong>Features Left to Implement</strong></h3>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        A feature idea i have to implement in the future is where you can login in to the page or just enter your name. With that to be able to play against your friends online.

<h2>
Testing
</h2>
<hr>

<p>
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

<h3>
Unfixed Bugs
</h3>

<p>
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
</p>

<h2>
Deployment
</h2>
<hr>

<p>
This section of the ReadMe file i will explain how, and what type of hosting platform is used.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                In the GitHub Repository, navigate to the settings tab
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                In the settings tab navigate down the page until you find the seperate tab for pages.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                When you are on the pages page, Select the master branch. Click save right next to it.
                When you have saved the page and refreshed the site, the project is deployed through GitHub.
